This program deals with managing information about students. It reads from a file and takes a student's first name last name grades and IDs. The Student class uses getters and setters for the fields. The classes are private fields with int strings and double attributes. The data is used to read from the file and initialize Student objects. The StudentManager Class handles most of the main tasks of the program. It takes an array of students to store and manipulate students objects.
